# Avionics
A project to create a basic avionics program

This project was begun due to my passion about spaceflight and everything that goes fast.
This project hopes to include:
•	A basic atmospheric model
•	Engine thrust modelling (momentum and pressure) for an ideally expanded engine
•	Rocket mass modelling
•	Acceleration modelling
•	Velocity modelling 
•	Position modelling
•	Drag
•	Staging
